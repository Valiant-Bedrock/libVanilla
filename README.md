# libVanilla
A project to add vanilla functionality into PMMP.
As this project was created specifically to support anvils/enchanting, those are the only two features to be enabled right now.
Any contributions are *greatly* appreciated. If you have a feature request, please submit one [here](https://github.com/Valiant-Bedrock/libVanilla/issues).

Disclaimer: _PHP 8 or later is required to use this plugin._

### Current/Future Feature Set
- [x] Anvils
- [x] Enchanting
- [ ] Mobs
